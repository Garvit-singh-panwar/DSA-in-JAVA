// Nested loops in Java mean putting one loop inside another loop. You can nest:

// for loops inside for loops

// while loops inside for loops

// for inside while, etc.

// syntax: 

// for(initilization; condition; updation ){   //outer loop

//      for(initilization ; condiiton ; updation){   // inner loop
                // do something
//       }

// }
